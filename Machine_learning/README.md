# Machine Learning Labs

This folder contains practical lab exercises covering fundamental machine learning methods.  
Each lab builds on real-world datasets using scikit-learn and related libraries.

## Lab Overview

- **Lab 1 – k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN)**  
  Using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset to classify tumour samples.  
  Includes hyperparameter tuning (varying *k*) and accuracy evaluation.  

- **Lab 2 – Logistic Regression**  
  Binary classification using logistic regression.  

- **Lab 3 – Decision Trees**  
  Building and visualising decision trees for classification tasks.  

- **Lab 4 – Random Forest**  
  Ensemble learning with random forests for improved accuracy and robustness.  

- **Lab 5 – Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**  
  Applying SVMs for classification with kernel functions.  

- **Lab 6 – Naive Bayes**  
  Probabilistic classification with Naive Bayes.  

- **Lab 7 – k-Means Clustering**  
  Unsupervised clustering using the k-Means algorithm.  

- **Lab 8 – Dimensionality Reduction**  
  Techniques such as PCA for reducing dataset dimensionality.  

- **Lab 9 – Neural Networks**  
  Basics of feedforward neural networks for classification.  

- **Lab 10 – Ensemble Methods**  
  Combining multiple models (e.g., bagging, boosting) to improve performance.

## Notes

- Labs demonstrate both supervised and unsupervised methods.  
- Focus is on model training, evaluation, and comparison of algorithms.  
- Each PDF includes dataset links, preprocessing steps, code, and results.  

This project was completed as part of the Bachelor of Computer Science degree at the University of Waikato.
