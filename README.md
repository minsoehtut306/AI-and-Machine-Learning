# AI and Machine Learning Projects  

## Overview  
This folder collects coursework and projects related to **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**. It is divided into two main parts:  

- **Artificial Intelligence** – Classic AI search problems, optimization, adversarial game-playing, and text models.  
- **Machine Learning** – Lab-based exercises using Python/Colab, covering supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and neural networks.  

Each subfolder contains its own README with more details about the contents and how to run them.  

## Structure  

### AI  
Includes implementations of search and optimization problems in Python:  
- **ZenPuzzleGarden_Search** – AI search algorithms (BFS, A*, Beam Search) applied to puzzle solving.  
- **EinStein_AdversarialAndMCTS** – Adversarial search and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for the board game EinStein.  
- **KNetWalk_Optimisation** – Constraint satisfaction and optimization for the NetWalk puzzle.  
- **MarkovNgram_TextModels** – Markov chains and n-gram models for text generation.  

Each project has its own **README** with usage instructions and example runs.  

### Machine Learning  
Step-by-step lab exercises (in Jupyter/Colab notebooks) covering ML fundamentals:  
- **Lab 1–10**: cover topics like data preprocessing, regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and deep learning basics.  
- Each lab has a corresponding **README** explaining the focus of the exercise and how to run it.  

## How to Run  
- **AI projects**:  
  - Written in **Python 3**.  
  - Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).  
  - Run each script using `python filename.py`.  

- **Machine Learning labs**:  
  - Open `.ipynb` notebooks in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.  
  - Follow instructions provided in each notebook’s README.

### Note

This project was completed as part of the Bachelor of Computer Science degree at the University of Waikato.  
It is published here solely for educational and portfolio purposes, to showcase my skills in software development.  

All code presented is my own work. Course-specific materials such as assignment descriptions or test data are not included to respect university policies.
